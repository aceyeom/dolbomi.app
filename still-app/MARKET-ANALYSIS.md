## 0. Executive summary — the one-paragraph verdict

The reciprocal-crush mechanic is **proven to go viral and proven to die**, and the specific
twist that defines CELESTE — letting a user enter a *named, non-consenting third party's*
Instagram handle and inferring a romantic interest about them — is the single most
legally radioactive version of the pattern we could find. Two independent regulatory
walls stand directly in front of the current design: (1) **FTC/Sendit/NGL** enforcement
against *fabricated engagement and paid "reveals"* — which the product's live **fake demo
match** and any future **"someone entered you" count** walk straight into; and (2) **GDPR
Article 9 / Korea PIPA Article 23**, under which storing "someone romantically desires
person B" is **inferred sexual-orientation data about a non-consenting person — prohibited
processing, not merely unconsented.** The market opportunity is real but soft (dating-app
fatigue is opening a window; the niche has no measurable TAM), and even a flawless build
inherits the category's brutal retention cliff. **This is a "viral spike, then existential
risk" product.** It can absolutely catch fire; the work is making sure that when it does,
it is honest, age-gated, consent-bounded, and not a stalking tool — because every comparable
app that skipped that work is now a shutdown notice or a consent decree.

## 1. Is there a market? (size & timing) — **opportunity is real but soft**

### Dating-app fatigue is opening a window
- Global dating-app **downloads fell 9% YoY and MAU 3% YoY** in Q3 2024 (US worse: −14% / −8%). [Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com/blog/users-separate-from-dating-apps) — **high**
- **Tinder payers −5% YoY** (Q4 2024, to 9.5M); **Tinder MAU −11% YoY** (Q3 2024). Match Group cut **13% of staff** (May 2025) citing weak young-user demand. [Match Group Q4'24](https://s203.q4cdn.com/993464185/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-2024-Executive-Commentary_vF.pdf), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/08/tinder-parent-match-cuts-13percent-of-workforce-forecasts-revenue-above-estimates.html) — **high**
- **Bumble cut ~30% of staff** (June 2025); revenue shrank ~3.4% in 2024. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/25/bumble-to-lay-off-30-of-its-workforce/) — **high**
- Gen Z is shifting toward **IRL / serendipity** (singles events +42% on Eventbrite 2022→2023). [Eventbrite report](https://investor.eventbrite.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2024/Eventbrites-New-Report-Reveals-Why-Singles-Are-Shifting-from-Online-to-Offline-Dating-in-Favor-of-Shared-Experiences/default.aspx) — **medium** (interested party).

**Strategic tension worth holding:** users and youth engagement are *down*, but **spend is up** — top dating apps crossed **$3B consumer spend in 2024 (+10%)**. [Appfigures](https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/20250221) — **medium**. The fatigue is in *engagement*, not *willingness to pay*. That gap is precisely the opening for an "anti-app," low-pressure, novelty product — but it also means you're fighting for attention in a category users are actively tired of.

### The niche itself has **no measurable TAM**
There is **no third-party market sizing** for an anonymous-/unspoken-crush/post-breakup matching niche. The closest analogs are *features* (Facebook Secret Crush) and tiny startups (U Got Crush, Singapore), not sized markets. **Any TAM must be built bottom-up and labeled an internal estimate** — **thin**. Even the *base* market is definition-chaotic: global online-dating sizing ranges from Statista's ~$3.2B (narrow) to Grand View's ~$9.6–17B (broad) depending on scope. Lead with *consumer spend*, never a single headline TAM.

## 2. What's been tried: the reciprocal-crush graveyard — **viral, then dead or absorbed**

The "reveal only on mutual interest" core is **not novel** and recurs across a decade of apps. The pattern: **reliable viral signups, reliable creepiness criticism, reliable death-or-acquisition.**

| App | Mechanic | Outcome | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Facebook Secret Crush** (2019) | Name up to 9 FB friends / **IG followers**; reveal only if mutual | Still exists inside FB Dating; criticized as "creepy"/"stalker-ish"; **no standalone usage published** | mechanic **high**, usage **thin** |
| **Bang With Friends → Down** (2013) | Mark FB friends you're "down" with; reveal on mutual | 1M+ signups in 3 mo; **pulled by Apple (guideline 16.1)**, Zynga trademark threat; rebranded; **acquired by Paktor 2017**, faded | **high** |
| **LikeALittle** (2010) | Campus anonymous flirty posts | a16z-funded; 100+ campuses; **shut down July 2012** | **medium** |
| **Happn** (2014) | "Crossed paths," message only on mutual "Crush" | The **survivor** — still operating, ~tens of millions registered, reportedly acquired by Hello Group 2025 | **high** (early), **medium** (2025) |
| **AYI / FirstMet** (2007) | Yes/Skip on photos (pre-swipe) | ~3M MAU (2013, self-reported); rebranded; **went dark ~2021** | **medium** |

**Facebook's consent design is the lesson that matters most.** Secret Crush deliberately uses **your own consented graph** (FB friends / IG *followers* — people already connected to you) and reveals **nothing** to the target unless mutual. CELESTE inverts every one of those protections by letting a user type an **arbitrary stranger's handle**. That inversion is the source of most of §6's legal exposure. [TIME](https://time.com/5669789/facebook-dating-feature-instagram-secret-crush/) — **high**.

**Korea already has this mechanic shipping** (see §5): 짝지 (phone-number reciprocal match), 마음알림 (anonymous mutual-feeling notify). The reveal mechanic is **not the differentiator** — execution, the Kakao viral loop, and the Instagram-handle social layer are. The IG-handle approach is a genuine wedge against the phone-number incumbents, but it is *also* the exact thing that raises the consent/outing risk.

---

## 3. The anonymous-app death pattern — **how this category actually dies**

Across NGL, Sendit, YOLO, Sarahah, Secret, Yik Yak, Whisper, ASKfm, tbh, Lulu, Gas — the arc is near-identical:

1. **Explosive viral growth** riding a host network (Snapchat/Instagram link stickers).
2. **A "fake message → pay to reveal" monetization trick.**
3. **Rapid churn** once the novelty/curiosity is spent.
4. **Collapse via a safety/bullying/privacy event** — app-store removal, host-platform ban, regulatory action, or a tragedy.

Representative deaths: **Sarahah** removed from both app stores (2018, ~470k-signature petition after a 13-year-old was told to "kill herself"); **YOLO/LMK** killed when **Snap pulled Snap Kit** (May 2021) after teen suicide litigation; **Yik Yak** drowned in campus harassment → shut 2017; **Secret** shut in ~16 months and *returned money to investors*; **tbh** (positivity-only!) bought by Facebook then **shut for "low usage" in <9 months**; **Gas** acquired by Discord then **killed ~9 months later** (largely an acqui-hire). [Multiple — TechCrunch/CNN/Newsweek, full URLs in §8] — **high (pattern)**.

**Two structural takeaways:**
- **Host-platform dependency is fatal.** The apps that died fastest *were* their integration. CELESTE's reliance on Instagram (handles + deep links) is the same dependency — and Meta's Platform Terms prohibit unauthorized collection/use of IG data (App Store guideline **5.2.2** has been used to pull apps built on a service against its terms). **medium**.
- **Even positivity doesn't retain.** tbh was wholesome and still cliffed. Retention in this category is not a copy problem; it's structural (§4.3).

---

## 4. Growth, monetization & retention reality

### 4.1 Virality — the upside is real
- **K-factor:** >1 = exponential; for consumer apps **~0.4 is "great," 0.7+ is "next-level."** Sustained K>1 is rare. [First Round](https://review.firstround.com/glossary/k-factor-virality/), [Saxifrage](https://www.saxifrage.xyz/post/k-factor-benchmarks) — definitional **high**, benchmarks **thin**.
- **Nikita Bier's playbook** (tbh, Gas — the two most relevant comps): launch **one early-semester school**, target **40% penetration in 24 hours**, invert time-to-value ("if you can't demonstrate value in the first three seconds, it's over"), and **build monetization into the viral loop** ("the #1 support message was: can I pay to reveal who sent me polls?"). [Lenny's Podcast transcript](https://github.com/ChatPRD/lennys-podcast-transcripts/blob/main/episodes/nikita-bier/transcript.md) — **high**.
- **Seeding density before exposing the reciprocal gate** is the master lever. The same mechanic that's a ghost town at 2% penetration is delightful at campus saturation. This directly supports the product memo's §7.1 (liquidity) and §6.6 (Korea-first single-graph launch).
- **Seasonality:** "Dating Sunday" (first Sunday of January) is the category's peak (Hinge +27–31% likes); Valentine's and post-holiday "breakup season" are real spikes. The "December 11 peak breakup day" meme is **folklore** (a single ~16-year-old Facebook-scrape art project) — do **not** cite it as data. **thin**.

### 4.2 Monetization — the curiosity paywall works *and* is the legal trap
- The genre's proven monetizer is **"pay to see who likes you"** (Tinder Gold, Bumble Beeline; Gas's "God Mode" ~$6.99/wk funded the app to ~$1M in 3 months). [Synergy Labs](https://www.synergylabs.co/blog/why-every-app-nikita-bier-touches-finds-viral-success) — **medium/high**.
- These apps bill **weekly, impulse-priced ($6.99–$9.99/wk)**, not monthly — optimized for a short curiosity window.
- **Freemium dating conversion is low: ~3–8% of actives; payers are <10% for Tinder, <5% for Hinge/Bumble.** Payer ARPU ~$15–25/mo. [Business of Apps](https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/metrics/online-dating) — **medium**.
- **No reliable free-to-paid conversion % exists for Gas/NGL.** The durable metric is revenue-per-install (NGL ≈ **$0.16/install** by mid-2022, on 15M installs / $2.4M). — **medium**.
- **Is $2.99/extra-person sane?** Directionally yes for an impulse charge, and Korea's micropayment culture supports it (§5), **but** the one-off-per-person model leaves money on the table vs. the proven weekly-curiosity-subscription, and — critically — **charging into a reveal that may be fake or rare is the exact NGL deception** (§6.1). Recommendation echoes the product memo §2.2: monetize **speed + breadth** (instant-notify, multi-entry packs), keep the reveal free, and **never let a purchase prompt sit downstream of a fabricated signal.**

### 4.3 Retention — **the part nobody survives**
- Social/messaging benchmarks: **D1 ~25%, D7 ~9–11%, D30 ~2–7%** (varies 2–3× by source). [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-retention-rates/) — **medium**.
- Novelty comps collapsed hard: **BeReal DAU −61%** (Oct'22→Mar'23); **Clubhouse downloads −90%** (Feb→Apr 2021); **Gas −98%** post-acquisition; **Poparazzi** 6M+ installs → ~2–3k MAU before shutdown. — **medium**.
- Bier's own verdict on consumer-social retention: *"There's one every decade."* — **high**.
- **A reciprocal-crush app inherits BOTH curves at once:** the novelty cliff *and* the liquidity problem. The users acquired by curiosity are the ones who hit "pending forever" and churn. Expect a **steeper cliff than tbh/NGL**, which at least delivered a steady stream of (real or fake) messages. This is the strongest reason the product memo's §2.4 (make the rare match actually land) and §6.3 (an honest return loop) are existential, not optional.

### 4.4 The liquidity math (the "double coincidence" tax)
A mutual match needs a **specific pair**: A on the app names B, *and* B independently on the app names A. This is the economic "double coincidence of wants" — the failure mode of barter, whose entire point is that *"the likelihood of such a match occurring is low."* [Coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants) — **high (concept)**. Illustratively, if penetration of a person's crush-pool is *p* and they name any specific person with probability *q*, a one-way hit ≈ *p·q* and a **mutual match ≈ (p·q)²** — so at single-digit penetration the mutual rate is near-zero for the median user. **(Illustrative model, not measured — thin.)** This is the formal reason the category feels like a ghost town far longer than ordinary dating apps, and why **seed-one-dense-community** is the only credible cold-start strategy.

---

## 5. Korea-first — **the right instinct, with a specific playbook**

Given the `dolbomi.app` lineage, a Korea-first launch is well-supported:

- **Kakao is the distribution rail.** KakaoTalk ≈ **48.9M MAU, ~94–97% population reach**; the Kakao Share SDK is *the* viral/install primitive in Korea. Any consumer app launching here essentially **must** integrate Kakao share. [SeDaily](https://en.sedaily.com/technology/2025/12/30/kakaotalk-tops-as-most-used-app-by-koreans-in-2024) — **high**.
- **The viral genre is the personality/relationship test.** The "에겐·테토 (Egen/Teto)" hormone-personality test hit **714,250 participants** by May 2025 as the "post-MBTI" trend, explicitly framed around romantic tendencies — the closest analog to CELESTE's loop. Korean shareables win on **a share-worthy phrase + image** (the result-card aesthetics matter as much as the mechanic). [Daum](https://v.daum.net/v/20250523163004140) — **high/medium**.
- **Culture fits the product.** **썸 (sseom)** — the codified "more than friends, not yet dating" ambiguity before a 고백 (confession) — maps *directly* onto "do they like me back?" Korean Gen Z is also rejecting the "swiping mentality" for **자만추** (natural meeting), so an anonymous, non-swipe reveal may dodge swipe-fatigue stigma. [Creatrip](https://creatrip.com/en/blog/11074) — **high/medium**.
- **The "verified-but-anonymous" pattern is proven Korean DNA.** **Blind** (work-email-verified, identity-anonymous; 10M+ users) shows Koreans accept *verifying a real attribute to the platform while staying anonymous to other users* — exactly the model the product memo's §2.3 ownership-verification should adopt. [Korea Herald](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2976048) — **high**.
- **Payments fit micro-charges.** KakaoPay (~24M MAU, ₩43.1T/yr) and Toss (~24M MAU) are mainstream; Korea is **#4 globally in mobile IAP (~$6B, 2024)**; domestic dating apps already gate "likes" behind virtual currency that's effectively pay-to-use. A ₩3,000–4,000 (~$2.99) unlock fits established 결제 behavior. [Transfi](https://www.transfi.com/blog/south-koreas-kakaopay-toss-how-digital-wallets-are-dominating), [Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com/blog/state-of-mobile-games-in-korea-2024) — **medium**.

**Two Korea-specific cautions:**
1. **The mechanic already exists here** (짝지, 마음알림, SumOne, "니가너무좋아"). These are **phone-number-based and reveal nothing until mutual.** CELESTE's IG-handle reveal is the wedge — but Koreans' careful management of face/embarrassment (the whole point of 썸/고백 culture) and the constitutional rejection of forced public real-name (실명제, struck down 2012) mean an **IG-handle de-anonymization could face friction** unless the handle is strictly the *reward of a confirmed mutual match*, never exposed by default. **(Interpretation — thin direct evidence.)**
2. **Korea's churn is structurally high and expected** — 80.9% of new dating-app installers deleted within one month (2021). Korean dating apps monetize on *spend per session*, not retention, because users delete after a match. Plan the model around that reality.

---

## 6. Regulatory & legal — **the wall in front of the current design**

This is the best-evidenced section of the file and the one that should drive near-term product decisions. Four independent regimes each threaten the product *as currently built*.

### 6.1 FTC: fabricated engagement + paid reveals — **CRITICAL, and the current build is already exposed**
- **FTC + LA DA v. NGL Labs (July 2024): $5M total ($4.5M redress + $500K penalty), founders permanently banned from offering anonymous messaging apps to under-18s.** Core charges: **fake computer-generated messages** disguised as real friends ("engagement farming"); a **paid "reveal who sent it"** that delivered useless "hints," not identities (FTC Act §5 deception); **ROSCA** violation (recurring weekly charge up to $9.99 sold as ~one-time); **COPPA**; false "AI moderation" claims. Founders named **individually**. [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-order-will-ban-ngl-labs-its-founders-offering-anonymous-messaging-apps-kids-under-18-halt) — **high**.
- **FTC/DOJ v. Iconic Hearts (Sendit) (Sept 30, 2025):** litigated complaint (not a settlement) alleging the **same** fake-message + deceptive paid-"reveal" + COPPA pattern (116,000+ self-reported under-13 users). Two near-identical actions establish this mechanic as a **standing FTC target.** [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-alleges-sendit-app-its-ceo-unlawfully-collected-personal-data-children-deceived-users-about) — **high**.

**Direct application to CELESTE (mapped to the product memo):**
- The **live "demo · see a match" button** (`screens.jsx:230`, product memo §2.6) **fabricates a mutual match** — materially indistinguishable from NGL's fake "your friend sent you a message." **Delete before any public traffic.** This is not a gray area; it is the exact conduct that drew $5M and a founder ban.
- Any future **"X people entered you" counter** must reflect **real** users only. A fabricated or inflated count is the same deception.
- A **paid reveal/entry is high-risk if the value is overstated, the demand is fake, or billing recurs without clear ROSCA-compliant consent.** Keep the reveal genuinely delivering real info; if any charge recurs, meet ROSCA (clear pre-payment disclosure, express consent, easy cancellation).

### 6.2 GDPR Art. 9 / Korea PIPA Art. 23 — third-party sensitive data — **CRITICAL, and structural (a privacy policy cannot fix it)**
The product stores person B's handle + the inference "someone romantically/sexually desires B," where B never consented.
- An **Instagram handle is personal data** (GDPR Art. 4(1) "online identifier"; Recital 26 "singling out"). B is an **identifiable data subject even though B never used the app.** — **high**.
- **No Art. 6 lawful basis exists:** consent is impossible (A can't consent for B); legitimate interests **fails the balancing test** because B has no relationship with the controller and "cannot reasonably expect" it (Recital 47; EDPB Guidelines 1/2024). — **high**.
- **The decisive issue — Art. 9:** **CJEU C-184/20 *OT v Vyriausioji* (1 Aug 2022, Grand Chamber)** held that **inferred** sensitive data is fully within Art. 9 — data from which sexual orientation can be deduced "by an intellectual operation of comparison or deduction" is protected. So "A desires B" is **special-category data about B's sex life/orientation**, processing of it is **prohibited** absent B's own explicit consent, which is **architecturally impossible.** Fines: up to **€20M / 4% of global turnover** (Art. 83(5)). [EUR-Lex C-184/20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62020CJ0184), [gdpr-info Art. 9](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/) — **high**.
- **Korea PIPA** is parallel and *criminal-grade*: **Art. 23** makes "sex life (성생활)" **sensitive information** needing the data subject's **separate explicit consent** (impossible here); penalties up to **5 years / ₩50M**, plus turnover-based administrative fines (a **Feb 12, 2026 amendment raises high-severity fines to up to 10% of total revenue**). [KLRI PIPA](https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_service/lawView.do?hseq=61299&lang=ENG), [Hunton](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-cybersecurity-law-blog/south-korea-amends-privacy-law-to-authorize-fines-of-up-to-10-of-total-revenue) — **high**.
- **Art. 14 transparency** would require notifying every catalogued B within ~1 month — *legally required and practically self-defeating* (you'd have to tell people they've been secretly catalogued). **CCPA/CPRA** is lower but real: B is a "consumer" (resident, not customer) with delete/correct rights, and "sex life or sexual orientation" is **sensitive PI** under §1798.140(ae). — **high/medium**.

**This is the finding that should most shape the roadmap.** It cannot be papered over with a ToS. Mitigations (product memo §2.5/§4.2): **hash handles** (store keyed HMACs, not plaintext, so the raw crush graph isn't readable and "we only store a label" is less defensible-but-less-exposed), **auto-expire** entries, a **public suppression/erasure endpoint** ("block my handle from ever being entered"), and — most importantly — **geo-gate the EU/EEA and treat Korea's PIPA as a hard design constraint** until counsel signs off. Realistically, the *only* fully-compliant version reveals/stores the sensitive inference **only between two ownership-verified, consenting handles** — which loops back to the product memo's §2.3 keystone.

### 6.3 Stalking / harassment / duty-of-care — **CRITICAL (the feature is the harm vector)**
A "does my ex still think about me" tool that confirms a *named non-consenting* person's feelings is structurally a **technology-facilitated-abuse** vector. The "Crush Notifier"/"Breakup Notifier" lineage was already reported as tools that "help you stalk your crush." [ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Technology/facebook-breakup-notifier-app-helps-stalk-crush/story?id=12971622) — **high**. Severity is amplified by **outing-by-inference**: revealing same-sex interest can out a closeted person — irreversible, potentially life-threatening, and squarely the special-category data of §6.2.

Platform duty-of-care regimes now bite design directly:
- **UK Online Safety Act 2023** — likely an in-scope user-to-user service; **illegal-harms duties enforceable since 17 Mar 2025**; stalking/harassment are priority harms with required block/mute/report tools (which a **non-user target cannot use**); penalties **up to £18M or 10% of global revenue**. [Kennedys](https://www.kennedyslaw.com/en/thought-leadership/article/2025/uk-online-safety-act-how-to-comply-as-illegal-harms-duties-take-effect/) — **high/medium**.
- **EU DSA Arts. 34–35** name **gender-based violence** as a systemic-risk category and make the **service's design itself assessable.** — **medium**.
- **US Section 230 is NOT reliable cover.** *Lemmon v. Snap* (9th Cir. 2021) and *Estate of Bride v. YOLO* (9th Cir. 2024) establish that **negligent-design** claims and **broken-safety-promise / misrepresentation** claims **survive §230.** Any in-product claim — "anonymous," "no trace," "we protect you" — that isn't rigorously enforced becomes **independent, un-immunized liability.** The product's own copy ("No alert. No trace. Invisible unless they enter you back," `screens.jsx:164`) is exactly such a promise, and §2.3 shows it's only true against a passive observer. [CA9 Bride opinion](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2024/08/22/23-55134.pdf) — **high**.

### 6.4 App-store & platform rejection — **HIGH (likely removal)**
Apple's guidelines prohibit anonymous messaging and bar UGC apps used for "objectification of real people" or "bullying," and require report/block/contact mechanisms — **all of which presuppose the affected party is a user.** A target who is a non-user can't report, block, or consent, so the design fails the core safeguards. This is the same removal mechanism that delisted **Sarahah** and killed **Down/Bang With Friends** (clause 16.1). Meta's Platform Terms separately constrain using IG handles/deep-links. [Apple Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) — **medium**.

### 6.5 Minors / COPPA & email/anti-spam
- **COPPA + the NGL under-18 ban** show regulators treat anonymous, romance-adjacent apps reachable by teens as warranting *existential* remedies. The product has **no age gate** today (product memo §3). Add a real age affirmation; if under-13 data is ever touchable, full COPPA applies.
- **Email:** the match email needs lawful basis. Korea's **정보통신망법** is strict opt-in for commercial email; the match notification should be framed as a **transactional, user-requested** notification (the user asked to be told), verified at capture (product memo §2.4), with clear unsubscribe. *(One research thread on anti-spam specifics hit a session limit; treat email-law detail as needing a dedicated follow-up.)*

## 7. Synthesis — what works, what fails, and what this product must do

### What works (the evidence-backed upside)
1. **The reciprocal-reveal hook goes viral.** Down (1M signups/3mo), the Korean Egen/Teto test (714k), NGL/Gas (#1 App Store) all prove the curiosity loop ignites.
2. **The curiosity paywall is the genre's best monetizer** — *when it sits on a real reveal.*
3. **Korea-first is the right beachhead:** Kakao distribution, 썸 culture, proven micropayment behavior, and the Blind "verified-but-anonymous" template.
4. **The timing window is open:** dating-app fatigue + rising spend = appetite for an anti-app novelty.

### What fails (the evidence-backed downside)
1. **Retention.** Every comp cliffs — BeReal −61%, Clubhouse −90%, Gas −98%, tbh shut for "low usage." The category does not retain; novelty + liquidity cliffs compound.
2. **Liquidity.** The "double coincidence" makes mutual matches near-zero until a dense graph is saturated. Untargeted virality grows the pool but not *your* pair.
3. **Fabricated engagement is a legal landmine, not a growth hack.** NGL/Sendit prove it ends in enforcement. The current **fake demo match is already on the wrong side of this line.**
4. **Non-consensual third-party sensitive data is prohibited, not just unconsented** (GDPR Art. 9 / PIPA Art. 23). The current plaintext crush-graph is the most exposed asset in the product.
5. **The mechanic is a stalking vector by construction**, and §230 won't shield the design or the "no trace" promise.

### The five things this product must do before scaling (ranked)
1. **Remove the fake demo match now** (FTC §6.1; product memo §2.6) — S-tier, no tradeoff.
2. **Bound the sensitive-data problem**: ownership-verified, consenting handles only; hash + expire the graph; geo-gate EU/Korea until compliant (§6.2; product memo §2.3/§2.5/§4.2). This is the keystone — it simultaneously fixes safety, legality, and unlocks honest monetization.
3. **Never fabricate any signal** — counts, matches, hints — and make every safety claim literally true (§6.1/§6.3).
4. **Age-gate and design *against* the stalker persona** (kill the synchronous-yes oracle; per-target rate caps; suppression endpoint) (§6.3/§6.4; product memo §2.3/§4.1).
5. **Seed one dense community (Korea-first, single graph) before opening the reciprocal gate**, monetize *speed + breadth* not access, and make the rare match actually land (§4–5; product memo §2.4/§7).

### Go / no-go framing
This is a **high-variance "lightning in a bottle" bet**, not a steady SaaS. The honest base rate is: it most likely spikes and fades like its cousins, and its *specific* design carries a regulatory tail risk those cousins didn't (third-party sensitive data + stalking vector) on top of the ones they did (fake-engagement + minors). **It is worth a disciplined, Korea-first, consent-bounded swing** — *if* the founder treats the §6 constraints as product requirements rather than legal afterthoughts. The version that ignores them is not a smaller business; it is a consent decree.
